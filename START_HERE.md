# START HERE — Business operator decision tree

**Purpose:** Answer one question fast: *"What do I do right now for my business?"*

**Read this file when you sit down, are interrupted, or feel lost.**

**Rule:** If something below contradicts a `skill.md` or a binding standard, the **skill / standard wins**.

**Paths:** In a project repo, prefix with `.ai.biz/`. When Business OS **is** the git root (this repository), use `START_HERE.md`, `skills/`, `standards/` with no prefix.

## 0. Three things to know

1. **Truth before speed.** The agent rules in `.cursorrules` (Core Principles 1–7) are non-negotiable. Never claim "good plan" without verifying the logic.
2. **Skills do the orchestration. Standards bind the decisions.** You almost never need to read all at once — pick what your task needs.
3. **.ai.biz vs .work.biz:** skills, standards (`.ai.biz/`) vs business plans, pipeline, HANDOFF (`.work.biz/`).

@biz-session close                      # safe default — writes HANDOFF/NEXT/UNKNOWNS to .work.biz/, no git
@biz-session close commit               # + scoped commit (target project: .work.biz/ only; source repo: all changes repo-wide)
@biz-session close commit scoped        # + commit of HANDOFF/NEXT/UNKNOWNS only
@biz-session close push                 # + scoped commit, then git push
@biz-session close commit push          # all three: write state, scoped commit, push

# mid-session checkpoints (no close, no HANDOFF/NEXT writes):
@biz-session commit                     # scoped commit (same role rule), session stays open
@biz-session commit push                # + push, session stays open
@biz-session add                        # stage the commit scope only, no commit

## 9. Anti-patterns to refuse

- Claiming PASS when analysis shows gaps
- Hand-editing a gate to PASS in `.work.biz/gates.md` instead of running the promoting skill
- Leaving a gate at PASS after its evidence changed (amend or re-audit demotes it)
- Modifying protected files without explicit approval
- AI attribution markers in any artifact
- Logging real client data in planning docs
- Inventing a resolution for a blocker — pause and ask
