# NEXT — Tactical Next Actions

## Current Phase

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Strategy | Pending (host project); framework amend + gate self-checks shipped |
| Brand | Pending (gated on strategy-ready) |
| Pipeline | Pending |
| Sales | Pending |
| Execution | Multi-platform content layer: canonical voice profile, 9 platform guides, per-platform ops trackers, graded claims, voice convergence |

## Recommended next

1. **Smoke-test `@biz-advisory` on `future-strategy`** against its own feedback case (`.work.biz/feedback/20260820-small-rescue-team.md`) — does a cold run clear the calibration bar (reframe pass, ranked options with precedent, anti-advice, decisive recommendation)? Gaps become new BIZ-10 patterns (UNKNOWNS #12).
2. **Owner review/commit of the uncommitted `future-strategy` changes** — the earlier slim-down plus today's thin-client update merge (merged `.cursorrules` with family-path re-point + Source-resolution wiring, `.work.biz` skeleton appends, new `strategy/README.md` + `reference/BRAND_STATUS.md`); its `PATHS.md` still carries stale `/mnt/work/Projects/.ai*` paths.
3. **First `@biz-sources find` run on a live project** — seed `.work.biz/research/sources.md`, confirm the vetting step holds (UNKNOWNS #13).
4. **Smoke-test `@biz-archive` on a live target** (`future-strategy` once its uncommitted changes land) — `status` dry run, catch-up path for archived pieces missing `status.md`, tracker row removal.
5. **Smoke-test the new biz-session verbs on a live target project** — standalone `commit` keeps the session open, `add` stages without committing, `close commit scoped` commits bookend files only, task-ref lands in `.work.biz/active-ref` and the commit subject.

## Active tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 2 | Owner review of uncommitted `future-strategy` changes | Pending | Consumer repo; slim-down set + today's update merge (.cursorrules, .work.biz appends, 2 new skeletons); PATHS.md stale |
| 5 | Validate Substack + Threads guides against real published output | Pending | Both untested; no project has published to either |
| 6 | Regenerate `.tmp/*.skill` archives | Pending | Include voice profile, Substack/Threads, reconcile, platform tracker, graded claims, content status protocol, biz-archive, biz-advisory, biz-sources |
| 7 | Smoke-test `@biz-strategy amend` + re-certify | Pending | Fold out-of-tree docs; confirm changelog + stale NEXT flags |
| 8 | Verify REPLACE tokens filled for adopter projects | Pending | Pre-existing carry-over |
| 9 | Validate hardened content rules with a live LinkedIn draft | Pending | Compare hook/engagement to `post_01_the_spreadsheet_nobody_owns` |
| 11 | Validate Content Status Protocol on a live target project | Pending | Run publish + `@biz-social log` cycle end-to-end, incl. pillar assignment + VOICE_RETRO entry |
| 13 | Validate `@biz-strategy career` on a live project | Pending | Fill OPERATOR_PROFILE end-to-end; check the cross-check against certified strategy |
| 14 | Validate pillar loop + quarterly alignment on real tracker data | Pending | Needs a project with ≥1 quarter of publishes tagged by pillar |
| 16 | Smoke-test new biz-session verbs on a live project | Pending | standalone commit, add, close commit scoped, active-ref extraction; verify role detection in both a source checkout and a target project |
| 18 | Smoke-test `@biz-archive` on a live project | Pending | status dry run; catch-up for archived pieces missing status.md; verify tracker slim + aggregates stay truthful |
| 19 | Owner decision: deletion candidates + full dedup refactor | Pending | Deletion candidates listed in HANDOFF pending #10; dedup tradeoff in UNKNOWNS #11 — needs explicit owner ask before any deletion |
| 21 | Smoke-test registry fill on a live thin-client target | Done 2026-08-21 | `@biz-deploy-basic update` on `future-strategy`: sister tokens resolved at deploy, verifier validated the merged `.cursorrules` (PASS) after the pipefail fix; target's custom standalone layout (no registry rows) reports info-level "custom cell" notes by design |
| 22 | Advisory capability: `@biz-advisory` + `@biz-sources` + BIZ-10 | Done 2026-08-21 | 24th/25th skills; mandatory reframe pass + anti-advice + decisive recommendation calibrated on the rescue-team feedback case; 10-pattern library in `concepts/advisory-patterns/`; source catalog at `.work.biz/research/sources.md` with verify-before-citing seeds; registered across 10 surfaces; v0.6.2 |
| 23 | Smoke-test `@biz-advisory` on a live project | Pending | Calibration run against the rescue-team case (UNKNOWNS #12); gaps feed BIZ-10 |
| 24 | First `@biz-sources find` run on a live project | Pending | Seed + vet the catalog (UNKNOWNS #13) |
