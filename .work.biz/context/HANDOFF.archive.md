# HANDOFF Archive — older session summaries

> **Context budget (CONVENTIONS):** history is moved, never deleted. Older session blocks live here; the live `context/HANDOFF.md` keeps the newest blocks and carries a pointer to this file. Newest-first.

## Session summary (2026-08-13, close)

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| Diffed `skills/biz-session/skill.md` against `/mnt/work/Projects/.ai/skills/session-control` (skill.md + reference.md) | Done |
| Rewrote biz-session: full parse table (start/close/commit/add/context/status + commit/push/scoped modifiers + begin/open/end/handoff aliases), start protocol S1–S7 (goal capture, unblock check, env snapshot, task-ref → active-ref, HANDOFF Open mark, checklist report) | Done |
| Close protocol C1–C7: tree audit + secrets scan (halt), verification gate (change-safety scripts), follow-ups, always-shown commit message with BIZ-ref extraction, HANDOFF/NEXT/UNKNOWNS writes, scoped git (default `.work.biz/` incl. untracked; `scoped` = bookend files), post-commit SHA verification | Done |
| Standalone commit protocol M1–M6 (no HANDOFF/NEXT writes, session stays open) and add protocol (stage-only) — the two biggest parity gaps | Done |
| Kept biz-specifics: `.work.biz/` state writes, path-scoped commit shape in targets, CONTENT_STATUS pipeline brief on start, context mode with scoped status view | Done |
| Repo-role commit scope (owner directive): root `skills/biz-session/skill.md` detection; source repo → `git add -A` repo-wide (all modified/added/new files), target → `.work.biz/` only; applied across parse table, C6b, add protocol, context, edge cases, anti-patterns, completion checklist | Done |
| Routing sync: skills/README (row + verb table + `add`), .cursorrules + templates/cursorrules.template rows, START_HERE §6, .quick/session-lifecycle.md, SKILL_DEPENDENCIES, biz-director intents, PROCESS_ROUTER, README skill table, CHANGELOG Unreleased | Done |
| Gates: framework-verify PASS, gate-verify PASS (no ledger), touch-scope PASS, blast-radius WARN (9 areas — routing sync, acknowledged) | Done |

## Session summary (2026-08-10, continuation close)

The previous session (ses_0121) was interrupted right as it began implementing the approved six-improvement plan, after phase 1 (Content Status Protocol, committed as e08af92). This session resumed from the transcript and completed the plan.

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| #1 `@biz-review monthly` (I1b): assumption ledger re-grading, dead-assumption routing to amend, Re-validated date | Done |
| Drift-check scope narrowed to the five positioning files (ledger/changelog/ICP were false-positive by design) | Done |
| #2 `@biz-strategy career` (I2d): operator probe, Hold/Sharpen/Transition read, cross-check vs certified strategy | Done |
| #2 `OPERATOR_PROFILE.md` template in reference/ (deliberately not strategy/: no gate interference) | Done |
| #2 Wiring: biz-writing/biz-social I0, biz-content I0c, biz-youtube operator proof, biz-pricing I0b, greenfield pointer | Done |
| #3 Pillar loop: CONTENT_STATUS By pillar + Pillar column, CONVENTIONS pillar traceability, assignment in all four content skills + log mode, pillar column in both plan modes | Done |
| #3 `@biz-review quarterly` content-strategy alignment (conversations per pillar → amend) | Done |
| #4 `PROJECTS.md` proof-point bank template (dangling DIRECTORY_MAP ref closed); bootstrap + all manifests; sales-skill self-heal wording; content-skill proof wiring | Done |
| #5 Voice loop: CONVENTIONS § Voice loop (mandatory retro entries, empty-profile warning, amendment rule); publish checklists + log mode record; weekly coverage check; skeleton warnings in all content skills + bootstrap status | Done |
| #6 Session content pipeline brief at `@biz-session start` (ready/draft/last-publish + one suggested action) | Done |
| #6 Evidence discipline rule in CONVENTIONS; machine check evaluated (83 hits, mostly advice numbers) and rejected with rationale | Done |
| Appeal standard (6 bars) in Content Standard; anti-AI additions (5 banned constructions + 5 vocab rows + cadence rules) | Done |
| Skill checklists: biz-writing position question + position/scene self-critique, biz-social universal format + checklist, biz-content hook selection + step 5 | Done |
| Non-tech-host conditional tilt (UNKNOWNS #2) | Done |
| Routing sync: skills/README verbs (monthly, career), PROCESS_ROUTER, START_HERE tree + §3, biz-director intents, README table, .cursorrules + template | Done |
| framework-verify: bootstrap↔WORK_FILES manifest sync check (real self-check, extraction verified) | Done |
| UNKNOWNS #2, #9, #10 resolved; NEXT/HANDOFF/CHANGELOG updated | Done |
| Gates: framework-verify PASS (all checks incl. new one), gate-verify PASS, touch-scope PASS | Done |
