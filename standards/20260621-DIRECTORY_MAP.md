# Directory Map

Canonical layout of the Business OS framework and project memory.

## Framework files (`.ai.biz/`)

Stored in the source Business OS. In thin-client mode they are read from `AGENT_OS_SOURCE`; in fat-client mode they are vendored inside the project.

## Project memory (`.work.biz/`)

Stored in the consumer project. Never copied from source; owned by the user and `biz-*` skills.

```

**Path rule:** `biz-strategy` writes strategy artifacts to `.work.biz/strategy/`. All other skills read from `.work.biz/strategy/`. Do not scatter strategy files under `.work.biz/plans/`.

**Tracker rule:** `reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md` is the cross-platform index of what content exists and whether it is published. `pipeline/<platform>-tracker.md` holds per-platform performance. Keep them separate: a single shared metrics schema forces every platform to be measured by impressions, which is the metric least connected to revenue. Every tracker carries a conversations table, because a platform with reach and no conversations is producing authority rather than pipeline and should be reported that way. Who reads and writes `CONTENT_STATUS.md`, the lifecycle states, and the self-heal rule are defined in `CONVENTIONS.md` § Content Status Protocol.

**Archive rule:** when the operator asks to archive published content, `@biz-archive` moves each `published` piece from `ideas/<subdir>/<piece>` to `ideas.archive/<subdir>/<piece>`, mirroring the subdirectory structure. The `CONTENT_STATUS.md` row keeps its `published` status, date, URL, and pillar — archiving changes the file location, never the publish history; the move is annotated in the row's Note. Only piece directories move: loose files, category `README.md`s, research notes, backup dirs, and the legacy `ideas/VOICE_STANDARD.md` voice fallback stay in place. Moves use `git mv` for tracked files (staged, never committed by the skill) and plain `mv` for untracked ones.

**Voice rule:** `.work.biz/reference/VOICE_PROFILE.md` is the canonical location for the owner's voice definition. Content skills read it there first, then fall back to the legacy paths `ideas/VOICE_STANDARD.md`, `reference/VOICE_STANDARD.md`, and `reference/voice-profile.md`. Do not scatter voice rules across scoped documents: a voice file scoped to one directory only applies when work happens in that directory, which is how LinkedIn-only voice discipline happens by accident.

**Gate rule:** `.work.biz/gates.md` is the only authoritative record of readiness state. Each gate has exactly one promoting skill (see `skills/SKILL_DEPENDENCIES.md` § Gate Descriptions). Gated skills read it in their I0 pre-check; `scripts/gate-verify.sh` fails when a gate claims PASS without its evidence on disk.

## Protected project files

The agent must not modify these without explicit user approval:

- `package.json`
- `docker-compose*.yml`
- `Dockerfile.*`
- `.env*` (except `.env.example`)

## Resolution rule

When the source resolution section in `.cursorrules` says `AGENT_OS_SOURCE` is set, read framework assets from that path. Otherwise read them locally from the project's own `.ai.biz/`.
