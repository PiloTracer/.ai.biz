# Business OS skills (`.ai.biz/skills/`)

Portable, tool-agnostic business workflows. Each skill is a folder with `skill.md`.

**Identifiers:** Folder name = stable skill id (YAML `name:` in `skill.md` must match). Invoke as `@<skill-id>`.

**Invocation punctuation:** Use ASCII hyphen `-` between verb and argument (`@biz-strategy greenfield`).

**Work tree paths:** `{WORK_BUSINESS_ROOT}` = `.work.biz/` at project root.

## Naming protocol

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Shape** | `{prefix}-{role}` in **kebab-case** |
| **Business prefix** | `biz-` for **all** skills — business (`biz-strategy`, `biz-content`), infrastructure (`biz-deploy-basic`, `biz-deploy-files`, `biz-deploy-repo`, `biz-session`), and generative (`biz-writing`, `biz-social`, `biz-ideas`, `biz-products`) |
| **Stable id** | Folder name = `name:` in frontmatter = `@` handle |
