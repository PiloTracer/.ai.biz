# Skill: biz-content

## Purpose
Write and publish one piece of content (LinkedIn post, article, or native video) that demonstrates your expertise and attracts inbound leads. No pitching. No "DM me."

> **Platform scope:** This skill covers LinkedIn publishing ops (tracker, calendar, engagement cadence, A/B hook testing, consistency challenges, native video workflows). For generating content calibrated to other platforms (Reddit, Instagram, Facebook), use `@biz-social`. For pure writing craft (blog articles, case studies, landing pages, email sequences), use `@biz-writing`. For drafts, invoke `@biz-social write linkedin`, `write linkedin carousel`, or `write linkedin video` after planning.

## I0 - Gate pre-check

Before any mode executes, read `{WORK_BUSINESS_ROOT}/gates.md`. This skill's gate is **brand-ready**: publishing drives traffic to a profile and website, so those surfaces must already match the offer or the content converts into a dead end. A gate is met only when its `**Status:**` starts with the word `PASS`; trailing commentary after `PASS` is fine and does not change the verdict.

- If the file does not exist, or `strategy-ready` is not PASS, stop and emit:

```text
BLOCKED (prerequisite): strategy-ready not certified
  Required state: {WORK_BUSINESS_ROOT}/gates.md with strategy-ready PASS
  Current state: <what was found>
  To proceed: run `@biz-strategy greenfield` then `@biz-strategy certify`
```

- Else if `brand-ready` is not PASS, stop and emit:

```text
BLOCKED (prerequisite): brand-ready not confirmed
  Required state: {WORK_BUSINESS_ROOT}/gates.md with brand-ready PASS
  Current state: <what was found>
  To proceed: run `@biz-brand audit` then `@biz-brand overhaul`
```

- Exception: `status` mode is read-only and runs without the gate.

This check applies to `publish`, `plan`, and `challenge` modes (`status` exempt). To draft content before brand-ready, use the ungated `@biz-writing` or `@biz-social write` instead.

## I0b - Voice profile (binding when present)

Read `.work.biz/reference/VOICE_PROFILE.md` before drafting or reviewing any copy. If absent, check `.work.biz/ideas/VOICE_STANDARD.md`, `.work.biz/reference/VOICE_STANDARD.md`, and `.work.biz/reference/voice-profile.md`.

The Content Standard's anti-AI-artifact rules are the floor and always bind (zero em-dashes and en-dashes). The voice profile governs tone, rhythm, structure, and vocabulary above that floor, and its **texture** rules are deliberate: do not normalize them into polished prose. If it lists a **reference sample** for the format you are producing, read it and match its rhythm. If it makes an **owner pass** mandatory, label the output a draft and say so in the delivery.

Report which voice source you loaded, or state plainly that none exists and the output will be generically human. A profile that is still a skeleton (`<` placeholders remain, no reference sample filled) counts as none: warn plainly, because an unfilled profile adds a step without adding value (CONVENTIONS § Voice loop).

## I0c - Operator proof (read before drafting)

Read `.work.biz/reference/OPERATOR_PROFILE.md` and `.work.biz/reference/PROJECTS.md` if they exist. The profile bounds what the author can credibly claim; the bank supplies the numbers and named results. Draw every concrete result from `PROJECTS.md` and respect its disclosure status. A skeleton profile (full of `<` placeholders) or an empty bank counts as missing: say so in the delivery note, because content without real proof points is generic by construction.

## Parse invocation

| User says | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| `@biz-content publish` | Run the publish workflow (topic → draft → review → post → engage) |
| `@biz-content plan` | Seasonal calendar + batch scheduling |
| `@biz-content challenge` | 30-day LinkedIn consistency plan (default) |
| `@biz-content challenge - createimpact` | Same plan framed for LinkedIn #CreateImpact |
| `@biz-content challenge - 30d linkedin` | Explicit 30-day LinkedIn challenge |
| `@biz-content challenge - video` | 30-day LinkedIn native video challenge |
| `@biz-content status` | Content performance tracker review |

**Default:** `publish` if no verb matches and the user wants to create/post content now.

---

## Mode: publish — Write and post one piece

### 0. Load the content status tracker

Read `.work.biz/reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md`. If it does not exist, create it from `templates/work/reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md.template` before proceeding (self-heal rule, see CONVENTIONS § Content Status Protocol).

- Never pick a topic already marked `published` for LinkedIn.
- If pieces are marked `ready` or `draft`, prefer publishing or finishing one of them over starting a new piece. Say which one you are advancing.

### 1. Choose Topic

Pick from one of the four canonical topic buckets in `concepts/content-topic-buckets/prompt.md` (BIZ-09):

| Bucket | LinkedIn hook angle |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Architecture lesson** | A design decision, tradeoff, or mistake — with the specifics. |
| **AI in practice** | Real AI/ML experience — not hype, not theory. |
| **Experience-based insight** | Judgment that only comes from years of doing this. |
| **Project behind-the-scenes** | Specific, credible, ships — show the work with numbers. |

**Rule of thumb for hooks:** If you can replace your company name with anyone else's and the hook still works, it's too generic. Your hook should be specific enough that only YOU could have written it.

### 2. A/B/C Hook Testing
For the same story idea, draft 3 different hooks and pick the strongest:

| Style | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Hook A: Question-based** | "What's the #1 mistake founders make when choosing a tech stack?" |
| **Hook B: Result-first** | "How I built a financial platform in 7 months — solo" |
| **Hook C: Controversy-light** | "I don't use serverless for production platforms. Here's why." |

**Selection rule (appeal standard):** whichever hook wins, it must carry a concrete scene, a number, or a defensible position, and the post behind it must take a stance an informed peer could disagree with. A question-based hook earns its place only when the post answers it with something specific and owned, not a neutral survey. If none of the three hooks clears the bar, the story idea is not ready; sharpen it.

Test across posts: track which style gets the most engagement in your content tracker. After 8 posts, double down on what works.

### 3. Structure the Post
- **Hook** (1 line): Makes them want to read. Specific > general.
- **Story** (3-5 lines): What happened. Specific details (tech, timeline, problem).
- **Lesson** (1-2 lines): What you learned or what matters.
- **No pitch.** No CTA. Just value.

**Visual specs (if adding an image):**
- LinkedIn post image: 1200×628px, PNG or JPG, <5MB
- Carousel: 4-8 slides, 1080×1080px per slide, left-aligned text
- Use brand colors, no stock photos

### 4. Write First Draft
- Write like you talk. No jargon where plain English works.
- Use line breaks. Walls of text don't get read.
- Keep it under 300 words for posts, 1500 for articles.

### 5. Review Against Rules
- Does it demonstrate expertise? ✅
- Does it include specific details? ✅
- Is there zero pitching? ✅
- Would you want to hire the person who wrote this? ✅
- Appeal standard passed? ✅ — check `standards/20260621-CONTENT-STANDARD.md` § Appeal standard: defensible position, scene/number in the first two lines, named stakes with the feeling at the moment, specificity quota.
- AI-artifact scan passed? ✅ — check `standards/20260621-CONTENT-STANDARD.md` § Anti-AI-artifact rules (em-dashes, hedging, generic transitions, passive voice, empty intensifiers, banned constructions).

### 6. Publish + Engage
- Post it
- Within 30 min of posting, comment on 5-10 relevant posts from your target audience
- Reply to every comment on your post within 24 hours

### 7. Record the publish (mandatory)

Update `.work.biz/reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md` before the session ends:

1. Mark the piece `published` in the **Items** table with the date and post URL. Confirm the row names its pillar; assign one from the **By pillar** list if it was still blank.
2. Refresh the **By platform** row (published count, last publish date), the **By pillar** row, and the **Summary** counts.
3. Follow the file's "What to do after a publish" checklist: platform tracker row, `reference/VOICE_RETRO.md` entry, `plans/NEXT.md`, `context/HANDOFF.md`, weekly metrics.

If the operator reports later that they posted a piece outside this flow, record it the same way (or via `@biz-social log`).

### 8. Repurpose (Get 4 Assets From 1 Effort)

After publishing, repurpose the same content into different formats:

| Format | When | Where |
|--------|------|-------|
| Original LinkedIn post | Day 1 | LinkedIn |
| Expanded LinkedIn article (1500 words) | Day 3 | LinkedIn Articles |
| LinkedIn native video (60–90 sec, same story) | Day 5 | LinkedIn video post — use `@biz-social write linkedin video - <topic>` |
| PDF version (case study or guide) | Day 7 | Website lead magnet |

**Why repurpose:** Each format reaches a different audience segment. The video watchers may not read the post. The article readers want depth. One core insight = 4 assets.

## Mode: plan — Content Calendar

### Seasonal Content Calendar (Q1-Q4)

| Quarter | Theme | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Q1 (Jan-Mar)** | "New year, new platform" | Planning, architecture foundations, choosing the right stack |
| **Q2 (Apr-Jun)** | "Building in public" | Behind-the-scenes of current projects, lessons learned mid-build |
| **Q3 (Jul-Sep)** | "Deep dives" | Technical architecture deep-dives, AI integration patterns, scaling lessons |
| **Q4 (Oct-Dec)** | "Reflections" | Yearly lessons, what you'd do differently, planning for next year |

Align your posts to the current quarter's theme. It makes your content feel timely and deliberate.

### Batch Scheduling
Block 2-3 hours to write 4 posts at once. Follow the 45-60 min per post time budget, but save setup/context-switching time by doing all topic selection and hook drafting in one pass.

## Mode: challenge — 30-day LinkedIn consistency

Time-boxed posting program for **share expertise, grow impact, post consistently**. Use for LinkedIn official programs (e.g. #CreateImpact) or any 30-day cadence.

### Before you start

1. **`@biz-brand audit`** — profile communicates one expertise area in 5 seconds
2. **LinkedIn ICP** — if `.work.biz/strategy/linkedin-icp.md` is missing, run BIZ-08 (`concepts/linkedin-icp/prompt.md`) first
3. Read `standards/*PLATFORM-ALGORITHM-STANDARD*` — binding link and format rules

### Format mix (non-negotiable)

| Format | Frequency | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Text post** | 2–3× / week | Stories, lessons, hot takes |
| **Carousel (document)** | ≥1× / week | Highest organic reach on LinkedIn (3–5× text) |
| **Video** | 1× / 1–2 weeks once minimum setup is available | Trust-building, demos, behind-the-scenes, quick tips |

Draft carousels with `@biz-social write linkedin carousel - <topic>`. Draft text with `@biz-social write linkedin - <topic>`. Draft video with `@biz-social write linkedin video - <topic>`.

### 30-day plan table

Output this table. Rotate topic buckets; no same bucket 3 days in a row.

| Day | Format | Topic bucket | Hook seed | Challenge tag | Draft command |
|-----|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | text | Architecture lesson | Opening expertise statement | #CreateImpact if createimpact mode | `@biz-social write linkedin - …` |
| 3 | video | Architecture lesson / AI in practice | Mistake or number hook | — | `@biz-social write linkedin video - …` |
| 2 | — | — | Rest / engage only | — | Comment on 5 ICP posts |
| … | … | … | … | … | … |

**Cadence:** 3 posts per week (e.g. Tue / Thu / Sat or Mon / Wed / Fri). Non-post days = comment engagement on target buyer posts (10 min).

**#CreateImpact mode:** Add `#CreateImpact` on **one post per week** (days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29). Do not tag every post.

### Posting ritual (every publish day)

1. Post body — **no external links**
2. First comment within 60 seconds — links if needed
3. First 60 minutes — reply to every comment; comment on 5–10 ICP posts
4. Update `.work.biz/reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md` — mark the piece published with date and platform
5. Log in tracker (`status` mode): format, hook style, impressions at 48h

### Weekly review (end of weeks 1–4)

| Question | Action if no |
|----------|--------------|
| Carousel outperformed text? | Increase carousel ratio next week |
| Comments from target titles? | Revisit `linkedin-icp.md` hooks |
| <200 impressions after 6 posts? | Change hook style or posting time (see Failure Mode below) |

### Challenge completion

After 30 days: run `@biz-content status`, identify best hook × format combo (including video vs. text vs. carousel if video was used), continue at 2–4 posts/week using `@biz-content plan`.

### Video-specific challenge (`@biz-content challenge - video`)

Use this when the operator wants to make LinkedIn native video a primary trust-building habit. It follows the same discipline as the default challenge but adds production coaching and video-specific metrics.

| Week | Frequency | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Week 1** | 2 videos | Talking-head tips using mistake/number/controversy hooks. |
| **Week 2** | 2 videos + 1 screen/voice demo | Test which format gets better 3-second view rate and watch time. |
| **Week 3** | 3 videos | Add BTS or story format; test emotional vs. tactical hooks. |
| **Week 4** | 3 videos | Double down on the best-performing format from weeks 1–3. |

**Daily non-post ritual:** 10 minutes of genuine comments on target buyer posts before publishing.

**Weekly review questions:**

- Which hook formula kept the highest 3-second view rate?
- Which video type (talking head / screen + voice / BTS) had the best average % watched?
- Did any video generate comments from target titles? If not, revisit `linkedin-icp.md` hooks.
- Is the operator hitting the minimum setup (phone + window light + lapel mic)? If not, block setup time before week 2.

**Completion:** After 30 days, run `@biz-content status`, identify the winning hook × video-type combination, and commit to a sustainable LinkedIn video cadence (e.g., 1 video/week + 2 text/carousel posts/week).

## Mode: status — Content Performance Tracking

First read `.work.biz/reference/CONTENT_STATUS.md` and report it: what is published, ready, or stuck in draft on LinkedIn, and when the last publish was. Then reconcile: any post the operator names that is missing from the tracker gets recorded now (that is what this tracker is for). Only then review performance:

### Content Tracker Template

| Post | Topic Bucket | Format | Hook Style | Impressions | Engagement | Inbounds | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| | | text / carousel / video | A/B/C / video hook formula | | | | |

After 8 posts, look for patterns:
- Which hook style gets the most engagement? → Use that more.
- Which topic bucket gets the most inbounds? → Double down.
- What got zero engagement? → Stop doing that topic.

### Content Benchmarks
- B2B LinkedIn posts average **1,688–1,877 impressions** per post (Oktopost, 9,346 posts analyzed)
- Individual profiles typically get less reach than company pages
- **500+ impressions** is a fair starting threshold

## Time Budget

| Step | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Choose topic | 5 min | Pick from the 4 buckets |
| Write hook | 5 min | Must be specific enough that only you could write it |
| Write body | 15-20 min | Keep under 300 words |
| Review against rules | 5 min | Checklist above |
| Publish + engage | 15 min | Post + 5-10 comments on others' posts |
| **Total per post** | **45-60 min** | Can batch 4 posts in 2-3 hours |

## Success Criteria

A post is successful when:
- It passes the "would I hire the person who wrote this?" test
- It has **zero pitching**, zero "DM me", zero self-promotion
- It contains at least one specific detail that only someone with real experience would know
- **500+ impressions** within 48 hours with comments that are not from bots
- **For video:** 3-second view rate >30% and average % watched >40% (directional; validate against your own analytics)

## Failure Mode: "I posted and got zero engagement"

This is normal for the first 3-5 posts. LinkedIn's algorithm needs to learn who your audience is.

If after 6 posts you're still getting <200 impressions:

1. **Change your hook style** — if you used questions, try controversy-light. If you used results, try questions.
2. **Change your posting time** — try 7-8am or 12-1pm in your target timezone (US Eastern)
3. **Engage more** — LinkedIn amplifies people who give engagement. Spend 10 min/day commenting on others' posts before publishing your own
4. **Check your network size** — <500 connections limits your reach. Add 10 relevant connections/week
5. **Consider the content itself** — are you sharing a lesson or stating an opinion? Opinion + evidence outperforms pure lessons

**If the underperformer is a video:**

1. **Diagnose the first frame** — most viewers decide without sound. Does the first frame + overlay text communicate the hook in under 1 second?
2. **Check the 0–3 second spoken hook** — no preamble, no music, no "Hey everyone." Start mid-sentence with the promise.
3. **Check captions** — burned-in captions are mandatory; if they are missing or too small, silent viewers scroll past.
4. **Check the lesson specificity** — a generic tip in video form fails faster than in text because the camera exposes uncertainty. Add one number, name, or screenshot.
5. **Check energy and eye line** — low-energy delivery or eyes drifting off-lens kills trust. Re-record the hook until it feels direct.

If you reach 10 posts with consistent <200 impressions despite trying all of the above, the channel may not work for your niche. Test on a different platform — if you get the same result, the problem is the offer, not the channel.
