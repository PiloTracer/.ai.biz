# Skill: biz-discovery — Discovery Call

## Modes

This skill supports three modes via the `biz-discovery` command:

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **prepare** | `biz-discovery prepare` | Pre-call checklist: research prospect, pick relevant case study, prepare questions |
| **run** | `biz-discovery run` | Full call structure with 4 phases. Follow-up email within 24 hours. Log to pipeline tracker. |
| **status** | `biz-discovery status` | Read-only state report of discovery pipeline |

---

## Mode: prepare — Pre-Call Checklist

**Research basis:** SPIN Selling (Neil Rackham) and BANT are validated sales methodologies. Average B2B sales cycle is 84 days (Prospeo, 2026). Deals closed within 50 days have 47% win rate; deals beyond 50 days drop to 20%.

**Pre-call checklist (tick off before every call):**

- [ ] Re-read the prospect's LinkedIn profile and company website
- [ ] Note what triggered them to have this conversation
- [ ] Prepare 1 specific question about their company or situation
- [ ] Open case study library — which case study is most relevant to them?
- [ ] Check where they are in your pipeline tracker and what you already discussed
- [ ] Have a quiet place, charged laptop, stable internet, camera on
- [ ] Have a glass of water ready
- [ ] Close all other tabs and notifications

**What to have open during the call:**
- Calendar (to schedule follow-up immediately)
- Notes app or document (to capture key points)
- This skill sheet (as reference)
- Case study you selected

---

## Mode: run — Call Structure (30 min call)

### Phase 1: Open (2 min)

Goal: Establish trust and set the frame.

**Structure:**
- Thank them for their time
- Set the agenda: "I'd like to understand your situation first, then if it makes sense, I'll share how I typically approach this kind of project. Sound fair?"
- Start with a broad question: "What's going on that made you want to have this conversation?"

**Rules:**
- Do NOT pitch in the first 5 minutes
- Do NOT interrupt
- Your goal is to listen 80% of this call

---

### Phase 2: Discover (15-20 min)

Goal: Uncover the real problem, the impact, and whether they're serious.

**Use the SPIN framework (adapted for services):**

| Type | Question | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Current state | "How are you handling [problem] today?" |
| **P**roblem | What's wrong | "What's not working with that approach?" |
| **I**mplication | What it costs them | "What's that costing you in time/revenue/risk?" |
| **N**eed-payoff | What success looks like | "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the solution look like?" |

**BANT qualification checklist — capture these:**

- [ ] **B**udget — What budget range are they expecting?
- [ ] **A**uthority — Who else is involved in the decision? Can they make the call?
- [ ] **N**eed — What triggered this conversation now? Have they tried to solve this before?
- [ ] **T**imeline — What's their timeline? Must-have vs nice-to-have?
- [ ] What would success look like in measurable terms?

**Red flags to watch for:**
- "We're just exploring" (no trigger event, no timeline)
- "I need to run this by my partner/board/CTO" (no authority — ask to include them in next call)
- "Can you just give me a ballpark number?" (they're price-shopping, have not described their problem)
- Significantly undersized budget vs. problem scope
- They won't commit to a follow-up meeting
- They're comparing you to a commodity provider

---

### Phase 3: Match (5-10 min)

Goal: Show them you understand their problem and have done this before.

- Summarize what you heard: "So if I understood correctly, you need X because of Y, and the timeline is Z. Is that right?"
- Share a relevant case study or experience: "I worked on a similar situation with [anonymized client]. Here's what we did and what happened."
- Connect the dots: "Your situation is different because [specific detail they shared], but the architecture approach would be similar."
- Do NOT give a price yet. Do NOT commit to a specific scope yet.

**If they push for a price:**
"I can give you a range based on similar projects, but I'd need to understand your specific requirements better before I can give you a real number. Here's what I'd suggest: let me write up a proposal based on what we discussed, with a few options."

---

### Phase 4: Next Steps (3 min)

Goal: Clear, agreed-upon action.

| Outcome | Next Step |
|---------|-----------|
| Strong fit | "I'll send a proposal within 48 hours. It will have 2-3 scope options with pricing. Review it and let's schedule a follow-up to discuss." |
| Needs more info | "Let me schedule a 30-min follow-up to dig into [specific area] before I scope this." |
| Weak fit | "Based on what I'm hearing, I'm not sure I'm the right fit for this. Here's what I'd recommend instead: [referral or alternative approach]." Don't chase bad fits. |
| Not ready | "No pressure. Here's something useful: [link to a case study or article]. If the timing changes, reach out anytime." |

**Always send a follow-up email within 24 hours** summarizing what you heard, what you proposed as next steps, and the case study you referenced.

**Follow-up email template:**
```
Subject: Thanks — summary of our call / [Prospect Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation. Here's my understanding of your situation:

[2-3 sentences summarizing the problem in their words]

The approach I'd recommend:
[2-3 sentences on the proposed approach]

I'll send a proposal within 48 hours with a few options. In the meantime, here's the case study I mentioned:
[Link to relevant case study]

Questions?
Best,

[Your Name]
```

**Customize the template for each prospect.** The summary section is the most important part — it proves you listened. If they correct it, your proposal would have been wrong. Better to get corrected now.

### After the Call — Pipeline Logging

- Update pipeline tracker with the new stage
- Note: what's their real urgency (1-5)?
- Note: what's their budget comfort (range, not exact)?
- Note: who else is involved in the decision?
- Note: SPIN answers summary
- Add a follow-up task with a date

---

## Mode: status — Pipeline Report

Run `biz-discovery status` to view:

- Number of active discovery calls in pipeline
- Stage distribution (Open / Discover / Match / Proposal Sent / Won / Lost)
- Aging: calls stalled > 7 days without follow-up
- Conversion rate: discovery call → proposal sent
- Recent activity log

---

## Time Budget

| Phase | Time | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Preparation (pre-call checklist) | 15 min | Research prospect, pick case study |
| Open (2 min) | — | Set agenda |
| Discover (15-20 min) | — | Listen 80% |
| Match (5-10 min) | — | Show understanding, share case study |
| Next Steps (3 min) | — | Clear agreed action |
| Follow-up email | 15 min | Within 24 hours |
| Log in pipeline tracker | 5 min | Update stage + notes |
| **Total per call** | **1 hr** | 30 min call + 30 min prep/post |

---

## Success Criteria

A discovery call is successful when:
- You can summarize their problem in your own words and they agree
- You've identified whether they have Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline
- You have a clear next step (proposal, follow-up call, or "not a fit")
- You've sent the follow-up email within 24 hours
- You know whether to invest more time or move on

---

## Failure Modes

If discovery calls feel good in the moment but never convert to a proposal stage:

1. **You're not getting enough information.** If you can't summarize their problem clearly after 30 minutes, you didn't ask deep enough questions. Use the SPIN framework more aggressively.
2. **You're not identifying red flags.** Go back through the red flags list. If you ignored one during the call, that's why nothing happens.
3. **The follow-up is too slow.** Send the proposal within 48 hours, not "next week." Momentum dies fast.
4. **The prospect doesn't see enough value.** Your "match" phase may be too focused on what YOU do, not what THEY get. Reframe: "If we solve this, what changes for your business?"
5. **You may be booking calls with unqualified prospects.** Review your pipeline: where did these leads come from? If they're from low-quality sources, your pre-call qualification needs to be more aggressive.
6. **No clear next step agreed on the call.** If the call ends with "let me think about it," you didn't close the Next Steps phase. Always leave with an agreed action.
